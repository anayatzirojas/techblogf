<h2>HUMANS NEED NOT APPLY</h2>
<h3>By: Anayatzi Rojas</h3>

<p>The video "Humans Need Not Apply" was very interesting and it talked about many interesting topics. In the video it talks about how humans created new technology to get better at being “lazy”. They explain by using a example of horses and how they were replaced by cars. They also tell us that robots will eventually kick us out of jobs due to the technology getting more advanced as well as more cheaper. The technology will end up being better than humans, they prove this by giving us an example of the self driven cars that are already here. They state that the car will lead to less accidents due to the car will not be texting, getting tired or not looking at the road. Bots are being taught how to do many things like create music, write blogs ( like what I’m doing right about now) , basically they can do anything they just have to see someone doing it and they will learn by themselves how to do the task. 
</p>
<p> In my opinion the video was very intresting and made many valid points. After watching the video it many things in perspective because it kind of made me think of the Pixar movie called " Wall-E" and it basically proved the futre. The tech is going to get so much better that humans won't have to do anything and will have anything within arms reach and I think I agree we are looking at ways to become more lazy.</p>

 <h2> BLOWN TO BITS </h2>
<h3>By: Anayatzi Rojas </h3>

<h4>SMILE WHILE WE SNAP</h4>
 <P>The passage was about how we teens carry around something so valuable that is called a cell phone. We carry a phone that has a camera and it allows us to either use it to our advantage or to our disadvantage. They use the example of catching a man that was groping girls in the MTA and they state that a girl was brave enough to take a picture and then share it so that they would be able to arrest him. This shows us that she used the tech do advantage to get justice.  
</P>
<h4>BLACK BOXES ARE NOT JUST FOR AIRPLANES ANYMORE</h4>
<p>This passage was about how many of the cars that our own parents drive have black boxes. Black boxes were created to get the last actions that airplanes take and they are put into the cars that we drive. They give the example of the car accident that happened and they were able to determine the speed of the car and they found out that the car was going 91 in a 65.
</p>

<h4>THE PARKING GARAGE KNOWS MORE THAN YOU THINK</h4>
<p>In this passage it talks about how when you go into a parking garage you get a ticket and at the same time your license plate is photographed. This allows people to know if you payed, or if you are a robber they will be able to see if that is your car.
</p>
 <h4>MY FINAL THOUGHTS </h4>
<p>Reading all the passages it made me see that even though we don't know that we are being watched is doesn't mean that it's not happening. The tech is getting advanced day by day and it allows us to have a greater advantage for our daily lives.</p>

	<p>Comment Text: I agree with your observation that technology is getting far more invasive than regular citizens know. I like the style of your blog and the background image. I just think that your divs could use some padding.</p>
